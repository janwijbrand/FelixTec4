# Slic3r (Prusa edition) printer profiles

Using information found in the CuraEngine profiles for the Felixprinters Tec 4 (part of the Repetier-Host distribution they provide) and the Simplify3D settings found in the Benchy benchmark gcode file that was provided in the Felixprinters' website download area, I compiled a Slic3r printer profile.

Use at your own risk, but it does work for me and provides nice prints of a fair quality.
